      MyVent will be a secure platform to report suspected child sexual abuse and other
      safeguarding concerns. Our goal is to make it easier for concerned citizens to
      submit information safely and responsibly so that trained professionals can take action.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe reporting:</strong> Submit details, evidence or observations. You may report anonymously.</li>
        <li><strong>Referral to authorities:</strong> Reports will be reviewed and forwarded to appropriate law enforcement and child protection agencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy first:</strong> Data minimisation and secure transport of any evidence â€” we prioritise victim safety.</li>

      <h3 id="urgent-title">If someone is in immediate danger</h3>
      <p>
        Call emergency services right away (for most of Europe: <strong>112</strong>). If you are in another country
        contact your local emergency number or local child protection hotline.
